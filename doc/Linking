Linking modes:

Janus supports two main linking modes. The normal (and default) mode is called
"link" and links individual channels. This is suitable for sharing a few related
channels between networks, without needing to share services, network opers, or
other unrelated channels.

The second mode is called "bridge" mode, and functions as a more transparent
bridge, intended to be used between different ircds on the same logical network.
Many of the commands and modules do not apply to this mode, and will not work.
